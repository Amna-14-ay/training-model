Pretrained AI Model Assignment
This repository contains the code for my assignment on utilizing a pretrained AI model to perform [insert task, e.g., image classification, text analysis, etc.]. The project leverages a pretrained model and fine-tunes it on a specific task to demonstrate the power and efficiency of using existing AI models for real-world applications.

Project Overview
In this project, I used a pretrained AI model from [mention the library or framework, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face, etc.] to apply it to [insert specific task, e.g., sentiment analysis, object detection, etc.]. The model was fine-tuned on a custom dataset to adapt to specific needs.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

[list any libraries or frameworks used, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, transformers, etc.]

You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd your-repo-name
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the code and see the results, use the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
You can modify the input data or parameters based on your needs. The results will be saved in the output directory by default.

Structure
main.py: Main script that loads the pretrained model and runs the task.

model.py: Contains the architecture and functions for the pretrained model.

data/: Contains the dataset or links to where the dataset can be downloaded.

output/: Stores the results and predictions made by the model.

requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.

Example Output
Here’s an example of how the output might look after running the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
Model Accuracy: 85%
Predictions: [List of predictions here]
